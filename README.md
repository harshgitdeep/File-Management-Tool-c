# File-Management-Tool-c
This program is a basic example of file handling and does not include error handling for cases such as input validation, file or directory access permissions, or other potential issues.

<b>File Management Tool</b> is a simple project built in C programming language that allows users to create, read, update, and delete files and directories on their computer. The program presents a menu with various options for the user to choose from, making it easy to navigate and perform these operations.

The project is designed for beginners who are just getting started with programming in C and want to learn about file I/O operations. The program utilizes various functions from the standard input/output and file input/output libraries, such as fopen(), fclose(), fgetc(), fprintf(), remove(), mkdir(), and rmdir(), to perform these operations.

The program provides the user with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to create, read, update, and delete files and directories.
